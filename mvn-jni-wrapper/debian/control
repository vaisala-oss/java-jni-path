Description: Makes JNI libraries in /usr/lib/jni/ available by default.
 Installs a `mvn` wrapper in /usr/local/bin that sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH before
 execution. This makes shared libraries in /usr/lib/jni/ available by default.
 This wrapper requires an underlying maven executable to work. The underlying
 Maven can be installed either with a package manager, or by hand, as long as
 it is in the PATH _after_ '/usr/local/bin'.
